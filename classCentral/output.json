From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R.", "We’ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.", "In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations.", "In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE)."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/intro-accounting-data-analytics-visual-14477"},

In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.", "So why use this approach?", "One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there. Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive. When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them.", "A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.", "A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.", "Recommended Background:", "The class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry. However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly. For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.", "Suggested Readings:", "Readings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project.

Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.", "Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously.", "At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning. Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change.", "The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.", "In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives?", "Course Objectives:", "At the end of this course, learners should be able to:", "• Recognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities", "• Understand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change", "• Distinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation", "• Explain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning", "• Examine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change", "• Develop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts"], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/planning-climate-change-african-cities-9146"},

At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. 8.02 is the second semester of the MIT introductory physics sequence. Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell's equations. We will study electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic forces, conductors and dielectrics, electromagnetic waves, and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002, and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin, proclaimed \"a Web Star\" by The New York Times, has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also, the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT's Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom. In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning, Electric Shock Treatment, Electrocardiograms, Metal Detectors, Musical Instruments, Magnetic Levitation, Bullet Trains, Electric Motors, Radios, TV, Car Coils, Superconductivity, Aurora Borealis, Rainbows, Radio Telescopes, Interferometers, Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, Mass Spectrometers, Red Sunsets, Blue Skies, Haloes around Sun and Moon, Color Perception, Doppler Effect, Big-Bang Cosmology. You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice, numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%), homework problems and simulations (20%), three midterm exams (15% each), and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get, your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally, his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics, 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare, iTunes U, YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world, that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms, and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once, and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-8-02x-electricity-and-magnetism-634"},

Grazing management is an example of such land use and represents a common problem in many regions of the world. The aim of this short course is to raise awareness of the environmental risks associated with unsustainable management of natural resources. This course uses Iceland as a case study because here traditional sheep grazing has been associated with extensive environmental degradation. We examine the sustainability of sheep grazing in Iceland and explore how history, socioeconomic factors and environmental conditions have influenced the management of grazing resources. The development of sustainable management practices needs to take into account ecological, as well as economic and social aspects. We can devise general rules and guiding principles for management based on our current understanding of the socio-ecological systems, but fine-tuning of specific management decisions, for example regarding stocking rates or the duration of the grazing season will have to be site-specific. A better understanding of the consequences of these practices and how their ecological impacts vary under different environmental conditions will improve management decisions and increase the sustainability of management practices in the face of ongoing environmental changes."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-sheep-in-the-land-of-fire-and-ice-13245"},

You’ll also become familiar with many popular tools and scripting languages. Whether you’re interested in becoming a pentester or simply curious about the profession, this course is for you.

The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered \"lifeline infrastructure\" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively. The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector. While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously. That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/cybersecurity-policy-aviation-internet-8819"},

Esto supondrá unos 15,000 millones de euros anuales. El valor de mercado de los UAV (vehículo aéreo no tripulado) o drones de uso civil, a nivel mundial, se cifró en torno a los 500 millones de dólares en 2014. Está previsto que esta cifra incremente hasta los 2,00 millones de dólares en 2018. Otras fuentes estiman que el valor de los UAV pequeños (con peso inferior a 20kg) sobrepasará los 8,400 millones de dólares en 2019, en el que el uso comercial de esta tecnología dominaría el mercado. De los 84,400 millones de dólares, unos 5,1 corresponderían a drones de uso civil. En definitiva, el auge del uso de drones para uso civil se une la innovación que viene asociada a la impresión 3D. Este nuevo método de producción de objetos ha dejado de ser un paradigma para convertirse en una realidad. Sectores como el de la salud, la automoción, el aeroespacial, el consumo y la arquitectura, está ya implantando estas aplicaciones."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/miriadax-impresion-3d-de-drones-14819"},

We cover the basics of how to decide whether or not to use an FPGA and, if this technology will be proven to be the right choice, how to program it.", "This is an introductory course meant to guide you through the FPGA world to make you more conscious on the reasons why you may be willing to work with them and in trying to provide you the sense of the work you have to do to be able to gain the advantages you are looking for by using these technologies.", "We rely on some extra readings to provide more information on the topic covered in this course.", "Please NOTE that most of the time, these documents are provided through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, which means that, to access them, you have to have a valid IEEE subscriptions, either does by yourself or through your university/company.", "The course has no prerequisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics and it presents technical topics by using analogizes to help also a student without a technical background to get at least a basic understanding on how an FPGA works.", "One of the main objectives of this course is to try to democratize the understanding and the access to FPGAs technologies. FPGAs are a terrific example of a powerful technologies that can be used in different domains. Being able to bring this technologies to domain experts and showing them how they can improve their research because of FPGAs, can be seen as the ultimate objective of this course. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced FPGA courses."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/fpga-intro-10673"},

Rutenbar"], "Course Description": ["A modern VLSI chip has a zillion parts -- logic, control, memory, interconnect, etc. How do we design these complex chips? Answer: CAD software tools. Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast: billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks). How do people manage to design these complicated chips? Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs. This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).", "Recommended Background", "Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms). An understanding of basic digital design: Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design. Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering. Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary. We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.e tools in this class."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/vlsi-cad-logic-428"},

The first course of the specialisation, Measuring Disease in Epidemiology, looks into the main measures used in epidemiology and how these can inform decisions around public health policy, screening and prevention. The second course, Study Designs in Epidemiology, provides an overview of the most common study designs, their strengths and limitations. The third course, Validity and Bias in Epidemiology, builds on the fundamental concepts taught in the previous courses to discuss bias and confounding and how they might affect study results. It also provides the essential skills to prevent and control bias and confounding and critically think about causality.

The cultural influences on psychiatric science include ideals of individual happiness; conceptions about what is ‘normal’; notions of rational personhood; and existing social, gender, and racial hierarchies/biases. We investigate these cultural dynamics and then look at the lived experiences of those who were diagnosed or living with the condition. Paying attention to culture and lived experiences accords with the perspective of “mad studies,” a recent movement to foreground the people who suffer and the socio-political conditions surrounding their experiences. Exploring cultural dynamics and lived experiences along with the scientific milestones prepares us to critically reflect on world of psychopathology and on psychopathology in the world. In our reflection classes we will ask, for instance, about the forces behind incredible increases in depression and attention deficit disorder; racial and gender biases in research and treatment; the apparent happiness epidemic; and the prospects of neurodiversity."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/history-mental-illness-53648"},

Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.", "This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives.

The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.", "The second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains.

They can be found nearly everywhere in today’s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.", "Organizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization’s survival.", "In this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization’s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.", "In sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of “seeing” and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/organizational-analysis-459"},

The current COVID-19 pandemic presents health care providers and leadership with heretofore unplanned demands to care for a tsunami of critically ill patients. They must contain contagion with limited supplies of vital medical equipment and facilities such as ventilators, ICU rooms, and even basic levels of personal protective equipment. Physicians, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists and chaplains care for critically ill patients across the continuum and assume roles they are not trained for, often with unclear responsibilities. They do not know how many patients they will have to serve or how to deliver care remotely using new technologies while adapting rapidly to new protocols, policies, and lines of command. Providers will struggle with managing distressing symptoms in dying patients such as pain, air hunger, and delirium in the absence of best practice guidelines or decisional supports in their medical records or institutional protocols for management of these symptoms. They communicate with patients and families hastily forced to make end-of-life decisions influenced by resource allocation. These may be decisions not aligned with the values or choices of patients and their families, placing them in direct conflict with their own values and experience. Additionally, telehealth patient visits and teleconferences have replaced face-to-face communication with patients and colleagues to limit the spread of this highly contagious disease. All the while, healthcare leaders will be face challenges maintaining morale and well-being while providers fear for their own health and infecting their families. The Coleman Palliative Medicine Training Program is offering this series of on-demand webinars to improve the competence and performance of healthcare professionals as these work to provide the highest level of care during these unprecedented times.

This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology.

Computer forensics investigators, also known as computer forensics specialists, computer forensics examiners, or computer forensics analysts, are charged with uncovering and describing the information contained on, or the state or existence of, a digital artifact. Digital artifacts include computer systems, hard drives, CDs, and other storage devices, as well as electronic documents and files like emails and JPEG images. The fast-growing field of computer forensics includes several branches related to firewalls, networks, databases, and mobile devices. Digital forensics technicians can find work with many types of organizations: government (local, state, and federal), accounting firms, law firms, banks, and software development companies. Essentially, any kind of organization that has a computer system may have a need for a digital forensics specialist. Some digital forensics specialists opt to start their own businesses, giving them an opportunity to work with a variety of clients. Computer forensics investigators provide many services based on gathering digital information, from investigating computer systems and data in order to present information for legal cases to determining how an unauthorized user hacked into a system. A digital forensics examiner does many things in the course of these tasks – protects the computer system, recovers files (including those that were deleted or encrypted), analyses data found on various disks, and provides reports, feedback, and even testimony when required. The employment outlook for digital forensics examiners and investigators is favorable due to the rapid growth of crimes involving computers (cybercrime). Learning Outcomes After the successful completion of this course, the learner will be able to: A. Understand the importance of a systematic procedure for investigation of data found on digital storage media that might provide evidence of wrong-doing. B. Understand the file system storage mechanisms of the operating systems. C. Use tools for faithful preservation of data on disks for analysis. D. Find data that may be clear or hidden on a computer disk. E. Learn the use of computer forensics tools used in data analysis, such as searching, absolute disk sector viewing and editing, recovery of files, password cracking, etc. F. Understand how to present the results of disk data analysis in a court proceeding as an expert witness."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/swayam-digital-forensics-45145"},

It also presents some aspects of why volcanoes are dangerous and volcanic hazards. Volcano monitoring relies on diverse approaches to infer the state of a volcano so many different instruments and techniques are used to monitor volcanoes. Predicting eruptions or forecasting future activity of a volcano is based on monitoring data. If activity level rises above normal the volcano is in a state of unrest. Magma often intrudes in the roots of volcanoes prior to eruptions. This process generates earthquakes as stress level is increased and ground deformation as the volcano expands in response to additional mass in its subsurface. Seismology and geodetic measurements on the surface of the volcano are thus key to monitoring subsurface conditions.", "As magma, molten rock inside volcanoes, approaches the surface it releases volcanic gas that finds its way to the surface, and geothermal activity can change. In addition to ground-based techniques, satellite observations are extensively used. The main monitoring techniques for volcanoes are explained in the course, with the aim that students understand both the concept of volcanic unrest and how it can be monitored, how eruptions can be monitored, and signs of volcanic eruptions as seen on instruments.", "Understanding the possibilities and limitations of present-day volcano monitoring for detecting magma movements is an important step in understanding volcanoes, evaluating hazards and for giving warnings of impending eruptions. The course thus provides information on how scientists predict future activity of volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. Monitoring data are interpreted in terms of models of subsurface processes such as magma accumulation during volcano unrest, and magma withdrawal during eruptions. The course gives an introduction to such models, used to infer the volume and location of magma movements in volcano roots, in particular those based on mapping ground deformation.", "The course presents examples of monitoring data and interpretations from recent eruptions and periods of volcanic unrest in Iceland and around the world, including the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull that closed Europe’s airspace.", ":", "and", ".

His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative. In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues. He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions. Sensing the significance of these stories as “functional cosmologies” he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/thomas-berry-6946"},

So why isn’t everyone doing it yet? Moving from a monolithic application to one that’s run by microservices comes with many many challenges! There are a number of good ways to implement this, and one of them is to use containers.Kubernetes, an extremely popular orchestration tool for containers, has a lot of moving pieces to worry about – and that’s before you even get to see a “Hello World” app. AWS’ managed Kubernetes service, EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), is a great option, and facilitates access to other AWS services like IAM, AutoScaling, and CloudWatch.Learning how to manage all of this can be a tough journey. The more you learn, the more you realize there are a ton of other things to tackle. In this course we’ll be building a whole architecture where you can learn best practices and advanced techniques around Kubernetes, EKS, AWS, as well as the skills required for maintaining a production-ready environment. We are going to take a real-world project and develop it over the duration of the course. There is a LOT in here, so you will need to be confident with AWS already.In this course you’ll learn how to: Apply what you’ve learnt to production environments running on EKS. Solve common issues and improve solutions on a normal Kubernetes setup. Find room for improvement on existing EKS environments, and implement solutions to close them. Develop architectures that are aligned to the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework. Make better decisions at the start of a new project in EKS, or migration from another Kubernetes architecture. Make your applications scalable, reliable, and highly available in Kubernetes, running under EKS.Please note that this course does not use the Hands-On Labs environment. The labs in this course build on each other, and they’re designed for you to follow along and build out the solution in your own environment, developing it over the duration of the course. We estimate USD $10-15 to cover the costs of EKS, Route53, VPC and your EC2 and Spot Instances, along with a domain name."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/acloudguru-a-practical-guide-to-amazon-eks-103731"},

Academic integrity entails honesty, ethics, transparency, accountability, trust in academic and research endeavours.

It is imperative to use some of the previously published content while writing an article with proper citations and references. It is, therefore, important to understand and learn how to ethically write an article to avoid the plagiarism issues while writing research publications.

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.", "Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".", "The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.", "This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.", "The course covers the three main types of process mining.", "1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.", "2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.", "3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.", "Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.", "The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.", "After taking this course you should:", "- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),", "- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,", "- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,", "- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),", "- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),", "- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),", "- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,", "- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,", "- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and", "- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/procmin-2445"},

From the 9th to the 7th centuries BC, during the imperial phase of Assyria’s long history, modern day northern Iraq was the central region of a state reaching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, and incorporating what is now Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as half of Israel, and wide parts of south-eastern Turkey, and Western Iran.", "In its geographical extent, this state was unprecedentedly large, and the distinct geography of the Middle East, with deserts and high mountain ranges, posed challenges to communication and cohesion. What were the mechanisms that kept the Empire running? This course explores the methods the Assyrian government employed to ensure unity and maintain loyalty across vast distances, using traditional as well as innovative strategies. Some of these imperial techniques have marked parallels in the ways modern multi-national corporations are operating, others will strike you as profoundly alien.", "This course focusses on how the Assyrians organised their empire by analysing key aspects, namely:", "· The CEO – the king, a religious, political and military leader, who is charged to govern by his master, the god Assur;", "· Home Office – the royal palace in the central region and the royal court that form the administrative centre of the state;", "· The Regional Managers – the governors and client-rulers to whom local power is delegated;", "· Human Resources – the Empire’s people are its most precious assets, its consumers and its key product, as the goal of the imperial project was to create “Assyrians”; an approach with lasting repercussions that still reverberate in the Middle East today; and finally", "· The Fruits of Empire – it takes a lot of effort, so what are the rewards?", "When we explore these topics we will contextualise them with information about the lives led by ordinary Assyrian families.", "Taking this course will provide you with an overview of the political, social, religious, and military history of the world’s first superpower.

The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more."], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/jews-in-china-3543"},

The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.", "The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present.

Week 2 focuses on what globalization is rather than what it isn’t: it looks at the structure of the international interactions that do take place. It turns out that the lion’s share of them are concentrated between countries that are broadly similar to each other. This session also presents a research-based framework for diagnosing cross-country differences versus similarities: the CAGE distance framework, where “CAGE” is an acronym for Cultural, Administrative (institutional and political), Geographic and Economic distances between countries", "Week 3 - Cultural Distance", "-This session will focus on the first dimension of the CAGE Distance Framework, namely Culture.

Our focus will be on how cultural differences at the national level affect international interactions and, particularly, international business.", "Week 4 - Administrative Distance", "-This session will focus on the second dimension of the CAGE Distance Framework, namely Administrative Distance. Administrative attributes specific to a particular country, such as autocratic policies or weak institutions and high levels of corruption, profoundly affect that country’s international connections—but so do bilateral/multilateral factors, such as whether two countries are part of the same regional trading agreement, or had a colony-colonizer relationship in the past. This session will provide you with greater insight into how differences in such respects matter, with a particular emphasis on variations in how business enterprises are structured and governed around the world.", "Week 5 - Geographic Distance", "-This session will focus on the third dimension of the CAGE Distance Framework, namely Geographic Distance. This session will look at how trade and cross-border interactions in general are influenced by physical distance, whether two countries share a common border and other geographic factors. We will also look at the significant regionalization of most cross-border interactions and discuss what underlies the strength of that effect.", "Week 6 - Economic Distance", "-This session will focus on the fourth and final dimension of the CAGE Distance Framework, namely Economic Distance. This session will look at how economic differences, particularly differences in per capita income, affect cross-border interactions. It will then focus in on emerging economies by examining the big shift of most types of economic activities towards them, how they differ from advanced economies, and whether advanced country multinationals are likely to be displaced by competitors from emerging economies as a result.", "Week 7 - The Implications of Distances for Business Strategy", "-In this session, we will review the three broad AAA strategies for dealing with CAGE differences: Adaptation, to adjust to differences across countries to achieve some local responsiveness; Aggregation, to overcome some of the differences across countries and thereby unlock cross-border economies of scale/scope; and Arbitrage, to exploit some of the differences across countries in order to achieve absolute efficiency.", "Week 8 - Globalization and You", "-This session, which is titled “Globalization and You”, looks at how globalization affects organizations and people, and in particular, you.

We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.

Equip yourself and learn more about what human rights are and how they work.", "In this course, we will introduce you to one of the world’s most intricate human rights systems: the European Convention on Human Rights. You will see when and how people can turn to the European Court of Human Rights to complain about human rights violations. You will learn how the Court tries to solve many of the difficult human rights dilemmas of today. We will look, amongst other things, at the freedom of expression and demonstration, the right to vote, and the prohibition of discrimination. And we will address the rights of migrants, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. And, of course, we will see whether it is possible to restrict rights and if so under what conditions. You will even encounter watchdogs and ice cream in this course. We invite you to follow us on a journey of discovery into the European Convention!"], "Course Link": "https://www.classcentral.com/course/humanrights-7413"},

What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground.

In particular, we will introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which allow sampling from posterior distributions that have no analytical solution. We will use the open-source, freely available software R (some experience is assumed, e.g., completing the previous course in R) and JAGS (no experience required). We will learn how to construct, fit, assess, and compare Bayesian statistical models to answer scientific questions involving continuous, binary, and count data. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development, explanations of the statistical modeling process, and a few basic modeling techniques commonly used by statisticians. Computer demonstrations provide concrete, practical walkthroughs.

We then move to the study of flows, where we revisit many of the same notions in the context of continuous-time dynamical systems.
